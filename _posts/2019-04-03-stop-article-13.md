Article 15 and 17 (previously 11 and 13) passed in the European parliament the 26th of March.

The vote about "opening up for voting about changes in the directive" were lost with 5 votes, 312-317. [After the vote 13 MEPs announced](https://emanuelkarlsten.se/03/13-ledamoter-tryckte-fel-i-den-avgorande-rostningen/) that they had pressed the wrong button and if all of these would have been resolved the outcome would have changed to a yes, and changes such as removing article 17 would have been voted on. Out of the 13 MEPs that wanted to change their vote were 2 Swedendemocrats.

There still exists some hope to stop the directive. The EU Council still have to approve the text formally. The most probable way that this directive can be stopped is if member states representing at least 35% of the population vote no. Currently the following member states are [against the directive](https://www.permanentrepresentations.nl/permanent-representations/pr-eu-brussels/documents/policy-notes/2019/02/20/joint-statement-regarding-the-copyright-directive):
- The Netherlands
- Finland
- Italy
- Poland
- Luxemburg

This sums up to about 120 Million people. To block we need about 180 Million. It would be enough if Germany shifted side, or UK. If Sweden changes side, and votes no it opens up for other countries to follow.

Therefore we demonstrate the 6th of April in [Lund]( https://www.facebook.com/events/2351754275043493/), [Stockholm](https://www.facebook.com/events/839818799684958/) and [Gothenburg](https://www.facebook.com/events/2248731041854164/). We want the Swedish government to vote no in the EU Council like all of the Parties in the Riksdag want, except the Socialdemocrats.

I'm one of the main organizers for the Lund protest and will also be one of the speakers. Hope to see you there!
