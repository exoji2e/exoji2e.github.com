During the pre protests in Germany about 3000 persons attended the Berlin-protest. Showing that they are not bots, which the lobby for the directive accuse the [5 million signatures against the directive](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet) of being.

There is also a music video spin off:
