Now I finally took the time to fix a theme for my blog, 
and I thought it was time to also write a post.

The blog is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), with the awesome framework [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
It's been around for quite a while now ([Code@LTH](https://codeatlth.org) has used it since 2015).
Basically it's a very simple setup process for a static site, with hosting included by GitHub.

At least it is very simple for someone that knows a bit of html/markdown and git. 
And has done it a couple of times.

Everything is represented by your text/code (compared to all the settings and hidden plugins that WordPress uses for example).

During the programming competition NWERC I coached the teams from Lund University. During the competition I live blogged at [nwerc-lu.github.io](https://nwerc-lu.github.io), also with jekyll. It went very smooth, and I managed to produce 10 posts during the competition, while the students coded!
