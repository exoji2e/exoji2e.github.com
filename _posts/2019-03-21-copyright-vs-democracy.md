Yesterday me and Maj got an [opinion piece published in Computer Sweden](https://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.716324/upphovsratten-ar-en-skam-for-demokratin).

The text is in Swedish. You can try to run it through a [translation engine](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=sv&tl=en), but no guarantees on the outcome.

The text includes:
- Democratic problems that current copyright legislation has.
- Descriptions of upcoming problems if the upcoming copyright directive is adopted in the European Parliament next week.
- Proposals of what copyright legislation we would like to see (reducing the time frame significantly, and introducing exceptions for non-commercial usages)
