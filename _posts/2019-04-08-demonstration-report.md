The 6th of April I organized a demonstration in Lund against #uploadfilters which still has not removed from the copyright directive.

The EU Council can still vote no to the directive. The goal of the demonstration was to persuade the Swedish government to vote no, which will help to make Germany do the same.

To block the directive member states representing at least 35% of the EU population has to vote no. If Germany votes no we have won. The vote has been rescheduled to take place on April 15.

In total about 50 people participated in the demonstration. We managed to get quite a diverse speaker list:

- Mattias Bjärnemalm (PP)
- Niels Paarup-Petersen (C) 
- Maj Stenmark (PP) 
- Louis Hyleborg (LUF) 
- Sasha Steneram (MUF) 
- Rode Grönkvist (UV) 
- Ellie Cijvat (PV) 
- Måns Magnusson (PP)

All the speeches were recorded and uploaded. My speech starts at [36:16](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yL9rLGmny0?start=2176).

It would of course have been nice with more people present at the demonstration, but I'm still very happy that we managed to do a successful demonstration with so little time time to prepare after the parliament voted for the copyright directive on March 26.
