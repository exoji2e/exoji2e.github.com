Google and gmail has now started serving ads inside their gmail app for android. It's a bit uncanny given how well known and established the email technology is. But well I guess gmail is easy to use, have quite good apps (web and android), and is reliable, that's why I still use it. 

Abandoning Google products with an android phone seems very annoying - you'd have to find alternatives for gmaps, chrome, gmail, google photos, and google calendar. The ecosystem lock in is very close to as bad as for iPhone users and apple.

But I guess I should try to break out. Soon. Before I get served ads when looking at my photos in the Google Photos App. I actually have a protonmail that I should start advertising...
