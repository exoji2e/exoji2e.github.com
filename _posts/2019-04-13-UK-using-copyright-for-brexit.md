On 10 am Monday the EU council of ministers will meet and vote on the copyright directive.

It will be adopted if countries representing 65% of the EU population vote Yes.

The following countries are so far against:
- The Netherlands
- Finland
- Italy
- Luxembourg
- Poland
- Estonia
- Sweden

This is not enough, these countries only make up 26% of the population.

However. Boris Johnson, member of the Tory party governing the UK tweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The EU’s new copyright law is terrible for the internet. It’s a classic EU law to help the rich and powerful, and we should not apply it. It is a good example of how we can take back control</p>&mdash; Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1110812485081333760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2019</a></blockquote>

What he does not explain is that the UK is planning to vote Yes to the directive. And if they vote no instead, they would block the directive.
To the left is the current no-sayers, to the right the UK is included.

The UK wants this terrible law to pass - to get another argument for Brexit. Very cynical. However regardless if they actually leave or not - this will definitely affect them anyways since EU usually propagate very hard for harmonizing IP-law when negotiating trade agreements.

It is probably a lost hope to make the UK change. We better hope the government of Germany changes its mind (with 200k protesters out on the streets in the last weeks), even though the odds are low. On Monday we know.
