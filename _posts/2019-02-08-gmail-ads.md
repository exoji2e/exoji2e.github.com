Google and gmail has now started serving ads inside their gmail app for android. It's a bit uncanny given how well known and established the email technology is. But well I guess gmail is easy to use, have quite good apps (web and android), and is reliable, that's why I still use it. 

Abondning google products with an android phone seems very annoying - you'd have to find alternatives for gmaps, chrome, gmail, google photos, and google calendar. The eco system lock in is very close to as bad as for iPhone users and apple.

But I guess I should try to break out. Soon. Before I get served ads when looking at my photos in the google photos app. I actually have a protonmail that I should start advertising...
