The European Copyright Directive has received a lot of negative feedback. It contains multiple very problematic parts for a free and open internet. Read about the directive at MEP Julia Reda's [blog](https://juliareda.eu/en/), or watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyUh9wOp_Rw). Almost 5 million European citizens have [signed a petition](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet) to stop the directive.

The official channel of the European Parliament on Facebook has twice shared a video that is greatly misleading about the copyright directive. I wrote [a comment](https://www.facebook.com/europeanparliament/posts/10161709651940107?comment_id=10161709743720107) describing the problems:
> Hi European Parliament. Now you re-posted this video again. Still with the misleading text "Parliament reached a new agreement", while there still has not been a vote. And also with Axel Voss presenting the criteria for exceptions incorrectly. According to article 13 your platform need to fulfill all 3 criteria:
1. Younger than 3 years
2. Have an annual turnover below EUR 10 million
3. Have an average number of monthly unique visitors of these service providers less than 5 million.
>
> Axel Voss only mentions criteria 2 and 3, and has an OR between them instead of an AND.
>
> To conclude: your video is NOT informative at all without clarifications. Why do you publish this video again, when the problems got pointed out the first time?

Also the European Commission wrote a medium post (now deleted, but [archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216094123/https://medium.com/@EuropeanCommission/the-copyright-directive-how-the-mob-was-told-to-save-the-dragon-and-slay-the-knight-b35876008f16)), calling peaceful protesters a mob.

This gives us a view of a very angry and biased European Parliament, since they promote legislation before the parliament has voted about it.

[Protests are scheduled the 23rd of March all around Europe](https://savetheinternet.info/demos), and the vote is scheduled for the 25th of March. Now EPP (European People's Party) are [pushing for the vote to be scheduled during next week](https://www.facebook.com/JuliaRedaMEP/posts/2266524776942716) instead. It is absurd and highly undemocratic to push a vote before scheduled protests.

What can you do to stop this directive?
1. [Call a MEP](https://pledge2019.eu/en) and make them pledge to vote against.
2. [Sign the petition](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet) to stop article 13.
3. [Attend one of the protests](https://savetheinternet.info/demos) the 23rd of March.
4. [Become a pirate](https://blipirat.nu)
5. Vote for a pirate party in the upcoming EU elections 23-26th of May.
