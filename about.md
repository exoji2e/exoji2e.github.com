My name is Måns Magnusson. I'm a software engineer with a MSc in Algorithms from Lund University (note: physics is unfairly scribbled all over my diploma). 

Currently I'm working in a research project at Skåne University Hospital in Lund, where we record 3D videos of pediatric heart surgeries (on children). Most surgeries can accept at most one guest, due to room restrictions, which means that there is a great need to record videos of heart surgeries for students, and for the research community of pediatric heart surgery.

On my free time I'm a competitve programmer, which means that I regularly participate in programming competitions. I also enjoy organizing them, and organizing other code/math related events. 

During my time as a student I started two non-profit organizations.

- [Code@LTH](https://www.codeatlth.org) (co-founder). We organize programming related events to inspire coding-happyness. I have given multiple talks on competitive programming and organized a couple of programming competitions.
- [Ung Vetenskapssport](https://ungvetenskapssport.se/) (co-founder and president during 2018). UVS organize camps for high school students in science sports such as mathematics, physics, and programming. I've been a lecturer at a selection of such camps, and was in charge of the programming camp 2017.
