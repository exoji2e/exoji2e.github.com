I'm a pirate! And I'm also on the [list for the Swedish Pirate Party to EU 2019](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressreleases/piratpartiet-presenterar-sin-kandidatlista-foer-europaparlamentsvalet-2019-2826209)!

If you want to help out in my campaign or in the general campaign for the Pirate party, you can:
- Become a member of the pirate party at [blipirat.nu](https://blipirat.nu).
- Talk to your friends and family about the Pirate party and digital politics.
- Contact me directly and ask how you can help out.

Having representatives from the [Pirate Party](https://www.piratpartiet.se/) in the EU is more important than ever. The EU is currently [trying to pass new copyright directive](https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/) that will make Internet platforms, like YouTube, Facebook and Reddit, liable for the copyright infringements their users works create. The copyright lobby wants the platforms to buy licenses from almost everyone, which is impossible, since there exists more than a billion creators. Almost every internet user is a creator. Instead of getting licenses these companies will try to filter away content that are copyright infringements. This method will censor too much since it seems impossible to implement copyright law as an algorithm. For platforms there are very clear economic punishments of not filtering enough copyrighted material, but no punishment for censoring too much content.

The only reason this is discussed, and is not law yet is the only pirate in the EU, Julia Reda. EU needs more pirates, and more people who understands the Internet, computers and technology. The digital society is society, and we can't have politicians who doesn't care or know anything about it.

If I become elected I will:
1. Try to reform copyright law: a maximum of 20 years of protection, and a wider protection for private use.
2. Increase transparency of the EU by writing about the work - like [Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu) has done the last 5 years.
3. Make sure to [continue to criticize](https://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.691385/datalagringsutredning) Sweden for continuing to require general data retention of the entire population even though the [European Court of Justice determined](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=186492&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=513449) that requiring general data retention is not compatible with the Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
4. Stand up for a free and open internet.
