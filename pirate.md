I'm a proud member of the Pirate Party in Sweden. 

During 2020 I'm a board member of [Ung Pirat](https://ungpirat.se).

I was on the ballot for the EU parliament in 2019, and I received 174 personkryss - not a lot, but considering being a newb in a small party, I'm quite happy about it. The Swedish Pirate party received 0.66% of the votes, which is way below what we would have hoped for. However we are happy that Germany sent one pirate and the Czech Republic sent 3 pirates to the European Parliament!
