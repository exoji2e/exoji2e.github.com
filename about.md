My name is Måns Magnusson. I'm a software engineer with a MSc in Algorithms from Lund University (note: physics is scribbled all over my diploma). 

Currently I'm working in a research project at Skåne University Hospital in Lund, where we record 3D videos of pediatric heart surgeries (on children). Most surgeries can accept at most one guest, due to room restrictions, which means that there is a gread need to record videos of heart surgeries for students, and for the research community of pediatric heart surgery.

During my time as a student I volontered for various non-profit organizations.

- [Code@LTH](https://www.codeatlth.org) (co-founder). We organize programming related events to inspire coding-happyness. I have given multiple talks on competitive programming and organized a couple of programming competitions.
- [Ung Vetenskapssport](https://ungvetenskapssport.se/) (co-founder and president). UVS organize camps for highschool students in science sports such as mathematics, physics, and programming. I've been a lecturer at a selection of such camps, and was in charge of the programming camp 2017.

My greatest hobby, that I apparently also became pretty good at is competitve programming. In 2017 my team Cache Flow placed 17th out of 120 qualified teams in the North Western Europe Regional Championchip (NWERC) in algorithmic probelmsolving.

I still participate in some programming competitions, that I'm allowed to participate in. Instead of competing at NWERC 2018, which I'm too old for, I'll be the coach of the teams from Lund University.
